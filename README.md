# Recipe Website Project

I am working on a project to create a simple website to showcase different recipes using HTML and CSS.

By completing this project, I will demonstrate my skills in:

- HTML structure: Creating a well-structured HTML document with a clear hierarchy.

- CSS styling: Styling the website with CSS to make it visually appealing.

- CSS layout: Using CSS to arrange elements on the page and create a cohesive layout.

- Responsiveness: Making the website responsive to different screen sizes and devices.

Overall, this project will give me a solid foundation in HTML and CSS and help me understand how to create a simple, functional website.
